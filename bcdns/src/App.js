We are CEO's of BadClup, our small organization with big dreams. We are students from Poland and we attend to one of the best high school in our country. We are creating this project because we were recently thinking about, why nobody did something like us before? Well, the answear is still unknown but we are trying our best to make decent dns system. Please, forgive us for our slight shortcomings, we were not doing anything like that in past, and It's also our first project, which is that big.";
