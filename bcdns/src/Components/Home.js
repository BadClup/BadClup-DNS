We are CEO's of BadClup, our small organization with big dreams. We are students from Poland and we attend to one of the best high school in our country. We are creating this project because we were recently thinking about, why nobody did something like us before? Well, the answear is still unknown but we are trying our best to make decent dns system. Please, forgive us for our slight shortcomings, we were not doing anything like that in past, and It's also our first project, which is that big.";

      "Choose BadClup today, for safety and fast DNS system. Uou may ask, \"What your DNS have, that the others ones have not ?\" Well, at first, it's 100% free, every person can create their own domain. Moreover, the domains aren't .com .org etc. It is your custom name. Of course, every other domain like youtube or facebook will still work. Keep in mind, that some names may be claimed already.";
