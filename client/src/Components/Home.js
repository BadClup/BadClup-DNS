      "You may ask: \"Who you even are? and why should I trust you?\" So well, my name is Tomasz Mamala, and I am working on this project with my dear friend, BartÅ‚omiej Strama. We are CEO's of BadClup, our small organization with big dreams. We are students from Poland and we attend to one of the best high school in our country. We are creating this project because we were recently thinking about, why nobody did something like us before? Well, the answear is still unknown but we are trying our best to make decent dns system. Please, forgive us for our slight shortcomings, because we are still learning and It's also our first project, which is that big.",
      "It's very simple! Just follow the steps on the wideo on the side. As DNS server use: 127.0.0.1 as prefered, and 1.1.1.1 as alternate. Of course in the IPv4 section. And that's all, now you can enjoy your own DNS!",
      "Choose BadClup today, for safety and fast DNS system. You may ask, \"What your DNS have, that the others ones have not ?\" Well, at first, it's 100% free, every person can create their own domain. Moreover, the domains aren't .com .org etc. It is your custom name. Of course, every other domain like youtube or facebook will still work. Keep in mind, that some names may be claimed already."
